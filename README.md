## Idea
### To create a decentralised and incentivised fund raising application for the startups, on Ethereum using blockchain technology.

#### Problems with today's fundraising application like KickStarter and Ketto.
The contributors and the donators have no knowledge of where their donated money is being used at or for. They have no control
of their raised funds once the contribution have been made. According to a research, 9% of the projects on KickStarter fail to deliver the product. The person who started the funding campaign may use the funds for his/her personal needs thereby dissolving the essence of whole fund raising idea.

#### Our idea
It is to implement a decentralised application on Ethereum Network using blockchain technology. Anyone can start a campaign through the application. The contributors can donate the money to the smart contract that we will deploy. Then the campaign starter request the smart contract to create a request to transfer the required funds to the desired vendor. Every contributor agrees to the created request and consensus if formed. If the number of approvals is greater than 50% of the total contributors or donators, the manager of the raised request can finalise the request and the transaction takes place from the contract to the vendors. In this process, the contributors also gets incentivised with the token from the smart contract at the time they contribute the funds for the first time. We are also using Machine Learning to suggest the contributors for the similar fundraising requests they can respond or donate money to.
